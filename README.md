# Awesome R packages for general purpose programming

> List of awesome R packages for general purposes programming, i.e. not related to stats, ML or data science

* R is one of the most advanced programming language on the market nowadays.
* R is based on the functional and vectorial programming paradigm. It is also an object-oriented language, a procedural language and I'm sure we can find a few more programming paradigm to add :-)
* R is also a surprisingly nice and fast language and can be used for any tasks, not just statistics, data science, AI and machine learning.

This is a curated and opinionated list of R packages for general purpose programming, which are not related to any of the topics above.

# Get started

To install a package in R, just start `R` on the command line (or use a notebook or RStudio or any R environment of your choice) and then type:

```R
install.packages('the_package_name')
```

You can of course install several packages at the same time with:

```R
install.packages(c('pkg1','pkg2','pkg3'))
```
If there are dependencies, R will install them automatically.

You can also to the same direct from the command line:

```bash
Rscript -e 'install.packages("a_package")'
Rscript -e "install.packages(c('pkg1','pkg2','pkg3'))"
```
